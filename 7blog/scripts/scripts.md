Scripts to perform various build, install, analysis, etc operations.

These scripts keep the root level Makefile small and simple (e.g., https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/master/Makefile).

Examples:

https://github.com/kubernetes/helm/tree/master/scripts
https://github.com/cockroachdb/cockroach/tree/master/scripts
https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/tree/master/scripts
